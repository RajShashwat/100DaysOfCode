# 1 Hour Coding Challange

## Question 1:

Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by __7__ but __are not__ a multiple of __5__,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.


## Question 2

Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.


## Question 3

With a given integral number `n`, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains __(i, i*i)__ such that is an integral number between `1` and `n` (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.

### Example 1
``` python
Input:
8
Output:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
```

## Question 4

Write a program which takes 2 digits, `X`,`Y` as input and generates a __2-dimensional array__. The element value in the _i-th_ row and _j-th_ column of the array should be i*j.

### Example 1
``` python
Input:
3,5
Output:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] 
```
## Question 5

Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
### Example 1
``` python
Input:
without,hello,bag,world

Output:
bag,hello,without,world
```

## Question 6

Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
### Example 1
``` python
Input:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again

Output:
again and hello makes perfect practice 
```

## Question 7

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
### Example 1
``` python
Input:
0100,0011,1010,1001

Output:
1010
```
