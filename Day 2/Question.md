# Reverse Integer

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

### Example 1:
``` python
Input: 
123
Output: 
321
```
### Example 2:
``` python
Input: 
-123
Output: 
-321
```
### Example 3:
``` python

Input: 
120
Output: 
21
```
__Note:__

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the __32-bit signed integer__ range: 
 **[−2<sup>31</sup>,  2<sup>31</sup> − 1]** 
 . For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
